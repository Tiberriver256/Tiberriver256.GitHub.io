Inspired by an excellent
[blog post](https://delba.dev/blog/next-blog-generate-og-image) by
[Delba de Oliveira](https://github.com/delbaoliveira) on how to set up automated
og:images in next.js using Cloudinary.

## What is an Open Graph image (og:image)?

An Open Graph image is a preview image that social networks use whenever a link
to an external website is shared. They are certainly very cool, and as
[Github has demonstrated](https://github.blog/2021-06-22-framework-building-open-graph-images/)
you can use them to convey a lot of information.

What we're building today is an automated method for building this image for all
my blog posts:

{% include
    image.html
      path="auto-generated-og-image.jpg"
      alt="An image showing a small photo of myself, my blog logo, my blog title, url, and tags"
%}

## What I want included in my image

- My photograph (auto-synced from gravatar)
- My blog logo
- My blog theme (font/colors)
- Title for my blog post
- Tags for my blog post

## How it's built

### URL Breakdown

Here's a full URL for you:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dhff6zdnc/image/fetch/w_1200,h_630,q_100/l_fetch:aHR0cHM6Ly90aWJlcnJpdmVyMjU2LmdpdGh1Yi5pby9pbWFnZXMvbG9nb19saWdodC5zdmc=/co_rgb:fff,e_colorize:100/fl_layer_apply,w_105,g_north_east,x_75,y_75/l_text:noto%20sans_54_bold:Too%20beginner%20to%20share,c_fit,w_1050,co_rgb:FFF,h_180/fl_layer_apply,g_south_west,x_75,y_135/l_text:noto%20sans_36:tiberriver256.github.io%20%7C%20%2523writing,co_rgb:ffe4e680,c_fit,w_1050,h_135/fl_layer_apply,g_north_west,x_75,y_512/l_gravatar:f2cc976ebe94f2bdaa2ff21801312836/c_thumb,g_face,r_max,q_100/fl_layer_apply,w_105,g_north_west,x_75,y_75/https://tiberriver256.github.io/images/Black.jpg
```

Let's break this giant url down into segments for inspection and then I can
share the liquid template

<hr>

**Segment**

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/<cloudinary-id>
```

**Description**<br> The base url to your Cloudinary cloud

<hr>

**Segment**

```
/image/fetch
```

**Description**<br> The base action for this url. `fetch` means that Cloudinary
is going to get the image from whatever url I place at the very end of this
giant URL. This is nice because I don't have to upload anything to Cloudinary.

<hr>

**Segment**

```
/w_1200,h_630,q_100
```

**Description**<br> The image that is fetched is going to be resized to 1200x600
maintaining 100% quality.

<hr>

**Segment**

```
/l_fetch:aHR0cHM6Ly90aWJlcnJpdmVyMjU2LmdpdGh1Yi5pby9pbWFnZXMvbG9nb19saWdodC5zdmc=/co_rgb:fff,e_colorize:100/fl_layer_apply,w_105,g_north_east,x_75,y_75
```

**Description**<br>
[`l_fetch`](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/transformation_reference#l_fetch)
grabs another image (my logo) from a base64 encoded url. My logo is an svg, so
Cloudinary can colorize it white for me using `co_rgb` and `e_colorize`. I then
place the logo anchored to the top-right `g_north_east` and set it to a width of
`105` pixels using `w_105`.

<hr>

**Segment**

```
/l_text:noto%20sans_54_bold:[BlogTitle],c_fit,w_1050,co_rgb:FFF,h_180/fl_layer_apply,g_south_west,x_75,y_135
```

**Description**<br> Here's where we actually get to insert my blog title into
the url using
[`l_text`](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/transformation_reference#l_text).
Cloudinary lets you use a wide variety of fonts. I chose Noto Sans as it was
similar to the font I have on my blog. I set the font-size to `54`. I set the
font-weight to `bold`. I ensured the text would wrap by using `c_fit` and a
width `w_1050`. I ensured it wouldn't go more than two lines by setting a height
`h_180`. I colored it white using `co_rgb:FFF`. I anchored it to the bottom left
using `g_south_west`. I placed it's anchored location using the x and y
coordinates `x_75,y_135`.

**Note:** This places the bottom of the text. As text wraps it will grow upwards
since we are anchored to the bottom of the photo.

<hr>

**Segment**

```
/l_text:noto%20sans_36:[website]%20%7C%20[tags],co_rgb:ffe4e680,c_fit,w_1050,h_135/fl_layer_apply,g_north_west,x_75,y_512
```

**Description**<br> Here I placed my tags using another
[`l_text`](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/transformation_reference#l_text)
layer. I set the font to `noto sans`. I set the font-size to `36`. I put in my
website url and tags as url encoded text. I colored it a light-gray using
`co_rgb:ffe4e680`. I ensured it would wrap using `c_fit` and setting a max width
of `w_1050`. I anchored it to the top-left using `g_north_west` I placed it just
below my title using the x and y coordinates `x_75,y_512`.

**Note:** I want the text to wrap downwards here and upwards in the title. This
is achieved using opposing anchors. The title is anchored to the bottom, and the
subtitle/tags is anchored to the top. This way they grow away from each other.

<hr>

**Segment**

```
/l_gravatar:f2cc976ebe94f2bdaa2ff21801312836/c_thumb,g_face,r_max,q_100/fl_layer_apply,w_105,g_north_west,x_75,y_75
```

**Description**<br> Here I placed an image of myself synced from gravatar using
[`l_gravatar`](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/social_media_profile_pictures).
`f2cc976ebe94f2bdaa2ff21801312836` is just an MD5 hash of my email address. I
transformed it into a rounded thumbnail ensuring my face was kept in focus using
`c_thumb,g_face,r_max,q_100`. I made it 105 pixels wide using `w_105`. I
anchored it to the top-left using `g_north_west`. I placed it using the x and y
coordinates `x_75,y_75`.

<hr>

**Segment**

```
/https://tiberriver256.github.io/images/Black.jpg
```

**Description**<br> We finally reached the end of the URL ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰!! This part ties
in with the first `/image/fetch` segment and tells Cloudinary which image all
these transformations should be layered on top of.

<hr>

### Liquid Template

Now that we have a nice URL, let's pull out the variables that we actually might
want to change from post to post:

- **Cloudinary CloudId** - Put it into the `_config.yml`
- **Website URL** - I could do `site.url` but I really want to strip the
  `https://` stuff so let's just keep it in the `_config.yml`
- **Post title** - Jekyll variable `page.title`, if it's not available (i.e.,
  homepage) we can fallback to using `site.title`
- **Tags** - Jekyll variable `page.tags`.
- **Gravatar Id** - It'd be smart to just extract this out into `_config.yml`
- **Logo base64 url** - Let's also pull this out into `_config.yml`
- **The background image URL** - Put it into the `_config.yml`

Let's set up my `_config.yml` with the following variables we'll need:

```yml
bareUrl: "tiberriver256.github.io"
ogImageBackground: "/images/Black.jpg"
cloudinary_cloud: dhff6zdnc
base64_encoded_logo_url: aHR0cHM6Ly90aWJlcnJpdmVyMjU2LmdpdGh1Yi5pby9pbWFnZXMvbG9nb19saWdodC5zdmc=
gravatarmd5: f2cc976ebe94f2bdaa2ff21801312836
```

Now with all that as a backdrop it was pretty simple to put together a little
liquid snippet to place in the head.html of my blog.

```liquid

{% if page.tags %}
    {% assign subtext = subtext | append: ' | ' %}
    {% assign tagsString = '' %}
    {% for tag in page.tags limit: 3 %}
        {% assign tagHashTag = tag | slugify | prepend: '%2523' %}
        {% assign tagsString = tagsString | append: tagHashTag %}
        {% if forloop.last == false %}
            {% assign tagsString = tagsString | append: ' Â· ' %}
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    {% assign subtext = subtext | append: tagsString %}
{% endif %}

{% assign ogImageUrl = ogImageUrl | append: '/l_text:noto sans_36:' | append: subtext %}

{% comment %}
    Color and wrap the subtext
{% endcomment %}

{% comment %}
    Crop the gravatar image
