I love to write blog posts and tinker with technology. I haven't been able to do
this for awhile for several reasons:

- I have two autistic boys that require constant attention when they are awake
- I have severe pain in my hands that prevents me from typing on laptop
  keyboards
- My home office is in my youngest child's bedroom which keeps me from blogging
  when my kids are sleeping

Needless to say... I've been stuck for quite some time. I think I may have found
a decent solution though, which is:

1. A bluetooth split keyboard
2. [Termux](https://termux.dev)
3. My Pixel 8 Pro
4. A [decent](nvchad.com) Neovim setup

The setup allows me to work with my phone in my lap in my recliner and type out
a blog like this one! Very excited to be back blogging again!
