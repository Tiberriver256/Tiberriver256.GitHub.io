This is a list I'm going to be maintaining on different ideas and thougths
around ramping up on new software projects.

## Grasp of existing problems

One component of ramping up on a new project is understanding existing problems.
You'll never find a project without problems. These problems come in all shapes
and sizes. They might be code quality issues, they might be slow running tests,
they might be style issues on the front-end, they might be architectural issues,
whatever they are, you are sure to find problems in any project that's been
around longer than a day.

I find a lot of newer developers are exhausted by this fact or feel it is a bad
thing to find problems. I believe it's the opposite. It's a sign you're starting
to get a good grasp of the project. What's important, is to not let the problems
overwhelm you and to surface those problems to the rest of the team.

As you ramp up, you'll typically find yourself in one of these three stages. The
final stage is where you want to be at.

### Finding and verifying problems

Ramping up on a new project, you'll find yourself getting aggravated by things
in the code or things in the project you're working on.

As you find problems, you'll be:

1. **Verifying it's a problem** - Lots of times, it's just a misunderstanding,
   or it's just something you weren't aware of
2. **Document the problem** - Jot notes about the problem down somewhere
3. **Surface the problem to the team** - When you're new to the team, it's
   essential that you discuss problems with the larger team. Raising awareness
   is key even if nothing can be done about those problems.

It's important to note, at the beginning you will rarely know how to solve these
problems. That's okay.

### Finding solutions to those problems

At some point, you'll have a firm enough grasp on the project to start seeing
solutions to the problems you've been identifying.

This is very exciting! For the first time, you're seeing a path to fixing the
problems that have been bugging you over the past weeks or months.

As you discover solutions, you should:

1. **Verify the solution with a more senior team member** - If it's a valid
   solution, awesome! If not, you probably will learn some key features of the
   project you're working on. Both are very valuable.
2. **Document the solution** - Jot down some notes about the potential solution.
3. **Share the solution with the team** - Discuss your potential solution with
   the broader team.

Important things to remember:

- **There are always multiple 'solutions' to the same problem** - You might
  solve the problem with documentation. Someone else might suggest changing the
  code to prevent having to write documentation. Both are valid solutions worth
  considering.
- **Don't expect your solution to get queued up in the backlog** - There are
  multiple solutions to a single problem. There are multiple problems. We will
  never fix all the problems. Team members who have been on this project longer
  likely understand the business context a bit better and will prioritize things
  in a way that may not make sense to you at this stage. The important thing to
  do here is to try and understand where your solution might fall on a
  prioritized list and **why** it was placed in that priority.

### Prioritizing solutions based on business goals and business value

As you continue identifying problems and solutions, eventually, you'll be able
to prioritize them based on your understanding roughly of business goals and how
much business value implementing that solution will add.

This is where you start to become an invaluable partner for the business. If you
were to visualize your list of solutions in a graph it might look like this:

{% include image.html path="prioritizing-solutions.png" %}

You'll always want to be recommending the business support work on the solution
that you've identified as the highest value for the least effort. When you can
**rank** solutions like this and **articulate** that value back to the business
you're fully ramped up.
