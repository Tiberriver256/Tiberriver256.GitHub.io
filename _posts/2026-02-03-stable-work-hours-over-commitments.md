I like stable, predictable work hours.

I learned that when you try to hook your self-worth to "commitments" or "getting
your work done" in an environment like software development where work is so
difficult to estimate your schedule can quickly become chaos.

## The Commitment Trap

When my worth depended on meeting commitments, I tended to get stuck in an ugly
cycle. I overworked when estimates missed—and they always miss, because this is
software. Missed a deadline? Grind nights and weekends to "prove myself."

Finish early (rare, but it happens)? I sneak out early or coast because I earned
it after all those 60-hour weeks, right? It feels like justified compensation.

Maybe this makes sense on a factory line with predictable quotas. But in
software? My commitments are based on my ability to predict the unpredictable.

## We're All Terrible at Estimating Software

We're awful at it. I highly recommend reading Software Estimation: Demystifying
The Black Art by Steve McConnell where he goes to great lengths to prove to his
readers exactly how bad we are. He of course then proceeeds to give you useful
techniques on how you can get better... but still... the problem remains.

We tend to either overestimate or underestimate and by a large margin. The more
common of the two is unfortunately underestimating the size which means you'll
more commonly (if you're like the rest of us humans) be working overtime rather
than getting out early.

## A Better Approach: Stable Hours, Improving Flow

So what do I do now?

I stick to my hours... sometimes this means I get extra stuff done because I finished earlier than I thought I would... sometimes this means I miss on commitments. 

Every time, though, it means my hours are stable and predictable.


## The Benefits

* **Stability** - Being able to tell my family when I'll actually be home. Not carrying
around guilt that "I didn't finish the thing I promised, so I must not be good
at my job."
* **Failure** - Failure isn't always bad... it's an opportunity to learn and improve. When I or my team fail to meet commitments within a reasonable timeframe we can talk about what went wrong and what we can do better next time. Overworking to hit a deadline short-circuited that value for me for a long time.
