I like stable, predictable work hours. There, I said it.

I used to promise a feature by Friday, work until 2 AM Thursday night to make it happen, then show up late Monday feeling like a hero. The next sprint? I'd estimate everything at triple the time because I was terrified of another all-nighter. My wife started asking if I actually had a job with set hours or if I was just making it up as I went.

When you hook your worth to "commitments" or "getting your work done," your schedule becomes chaos.

## The Commitment Trap

When your worth depends on meeting commitments, you get stuck in an ugly cycle. You overwork when estimates miss—and they will miss, because this is software. Missed a deadline? Grind nights and weekends to "prove yourself." 

Finish early (rare, but it happens)? You sneak out early or coast because you earned it after all those 60-hour weeks, right? It feels like justified compensation.

Maybe this makes sense on a factory line with predictable quotas. But in software? Your commitments are based on your ability to predict the unpredictable.

## We're All Terrible at Estimating Software

We're awful at it. I've read the books—Steve McConnell, the Pragmatic Programmers, all of them. The reasons why fill entire shelves. But the result is simple: you kill yourself hitting aggressive estimates, burn out, then sandbag everything for the next six months because you're terrified of feeling that pain again.

I've done this. You've probably done this. Neither pattern does you any favors, and it definitely doesn't help your team.

## A Better Approach: Stable Hours, Improving Flow

Stop asking "Did you meet your commitments?" Start asking "Are we getting better at our work over time?"

Focus on stable, agreed-upon hours. Whatever you and your team decide makes sense for actual productivity—not hero hours, not "prove yourself" hours. Then improve your flow, your processes, your code quality. Get better at the craft.

When something turns out easier than expected, don't knock off early to "balance the books." Use that momentum. Get ahead on the next hard thing. That success feeds the company, protects your paycheck, and doesn't leave you resentful when the inevitable estimation disaster hits next month.

## The Real Benefit

Stability. Being able to tell my family when I'll actually be home. Not carrying around guilt that "I didn't finish the thing I promised, so I must not be good at my job."

Software is wickedly hard to predict. There's no quota sheet to check at the end of the day. Work stable hours that keep you sane and productive, get better at your craft over time, and—here's the hard part—let go of the rest.

The developers who last in this industry aren't the ones who can pull all-nighters on command. They're the ones who stay consistent.
