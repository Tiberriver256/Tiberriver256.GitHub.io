# Show-HTML

This is just going to be a quick tip but I have missed posting up here. PowerShell has this SUPER useful command for rendering out HTML and of course HTML is really easy to spice up a bit as far as the looks go. What I had done in the past if I wanted to render out a script as an HTML report was convert it to HTML and then save it as a .html file and open it with whatever the default browser was. The problem is I then have to do a little bit of cleanup because I don't want to leave html report files all over the place.

So, why not create a tiny simple function to write the HTML direct out into an embedded WPF browser?

<pre> <code class="ps">


function Show-HTML ([string]$HTML)
{

    [void][System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName('presentationframework')
    [xml]$XAML = @'
    <Window
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        Title="PowerShell HTML GUI" WindowStartupLocation="CenterScreen">
            <WebBrowser Name="WebBrowser"></WebBrowser>
    </Window>
'@

    #Read XAML
    $reader=(New-Object System.Xml.XmlNodeReader $xaml) 
    $Form=[Windows.Markup.XamlReader]::Load( $reader )
    #===========================================================================
    # Store Form Objects In PowerShell
    #===========================================================================
    $WebBrowser = $Form.FindName("WebBrowser")

    $WebBrowser.NavigateToString($HTML)

    $Form.ShowDialog()

}

</code> </pre>
