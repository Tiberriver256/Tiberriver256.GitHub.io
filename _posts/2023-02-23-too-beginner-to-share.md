The other day, I saw a LinkedIn blog post and thought, _Well... that's pretty
basic. Who wouldn't know that already?_ and continued with my day.

Thankfully, the post came back up in my feed several times. It generated many
comments, and people were saying _Wow! I've never thought of that. That's a
game-changer!_

The lesson to learn for me was:

> What you think is basic/beginner/a given, other people may have never even
> heard of

So, when thinking about what you should write... nothing should be discarded as
'too beginner.' Get it out there!
