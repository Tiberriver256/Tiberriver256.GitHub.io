## How I studied

- Used a
  [community-owned practice exam](https://ghcertified.com/practice_tests/copilot/)
- Followed the
  [Microsoft Learn modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/gh-300t00)

## Who should probably take this exam?

People administering a GitHub Copilot rollout at their organization.

## My thoughts

As a user of GitHub copilot, I thought the courses on prompt engineering and
actual usage were pretty good but minimal. I've learned a lot more about GitHub
copilot reading through the
[GitHub Copilot for VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview)
docs which are fantastic.

The docs stated that it's targeted at adminstrators and for them I think it'd be
key. If you're managing GitHub Copilot for an enterprise you need to be familiar
with:

- How GitHub Copilot handles data
- What security options are available
- General list of features (enough to answer questions for staff)

For all that, this is great.

If you're someone more interested in, "How does coding with AI actually work?"
skip the cert. Maybe check out the learn modules. Comb the GitHub for VSCode
docs. Try things out. Go through
[promptingguide.ai](https://www.promptingguide.ai/). You'll learn a lot more.
