The other day, I saw a LinkedIn blog post and thought, *Well... that's pretty basic. Who wouldn't know that already?* and continued with my day.

Thankfully, the post came back up in my feed several times. It generated many comments, and people were saying  *Wow! I've never thought of that. That's a game-changer!*

The lesson to learn for me was:

> What you think is basic/beginner/a given, other people may have never even heard of

So, when thinking about what you should write... nothing should be discarded as 'too beginner.' Get it out there!
