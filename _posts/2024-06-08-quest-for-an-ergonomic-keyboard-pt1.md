If you didn't read my [previous blog post](./2024-05-30-blogging-from-android.md)
I'm hunting for a good method for keeping my tech experiments going from my living
room lazy boy. One of the key components to that is having a bluetooth ergonomic keyboard

## Why Bluetooth?

If I'm going to be popping up a little workspace here and there all over the house,
I want setup time and teardown time to be seconds. I also don't want anything dangling
because when I'm watching my kids I often have to jump up quick to help with something
and I don't want to get anything caught while I'm trying to get my keyboard off my lap.

## Why ergonomic?

Regular keyboards hurt... like... a lot.

I can only type on a laptop keyboard for about 15-20 minutes before my hands start hurting. I need
something that I can type on for hours without pain. I have a [Moonlander keyboard](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander)
which I use for work that lets me type for hours without a whole lot of pain. I need something similar.

## What I tried

I just bought the [ErgodoxLP Wireless by SliceMK](https://www.slicemk.com/products/ergodoxlp-wireless) which
is a fantastic little keyboard. I discovered though that I cannot handle the low-profile keyboard and low-profile
switches. They are too similar to a laptop for me. I typed on it for about an hour today at the library and 
had sever pain in my hands for about two hours after that. Definitely not a good fit.

## What's next?

I'm debating between these two options:

* [Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/)
* [Svalboard](https://svalboard.com/)

### Glove80

Pros:

* Wireless
* Split
* Ergonomic

Cons:

* Low-profile switches might cause the same pain I experienced with the ErgodoxLP

### Svalboard

Pros:

* Highly ergonomic - Likely to be even less pain than my Moonlander just due to the lack of movement
* Mouse embedded in keyboard - You can get a trackball right in the keyboard which reduces the clutter of
my working environment even further

Cons:

* Not wireless - Kinda sucks that it's not wirelss but it would hook straight into my phone with a usb-c and
without the mouse there it might not be that big of a deal
* Cost - These suckers come in at around $800 and I just had a plumbing emergency at home cost me $11k so I'm not sure I'll be able to affort these guys too soon
