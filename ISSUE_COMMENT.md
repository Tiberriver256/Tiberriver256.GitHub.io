## Research Complete! âœ…

You are **absolutely correct** - all 7 open Dependabot PRs are for npm packages that are no longer used by your blog.

### What I Found

On **January 11, 2023** (commit `7f1125b`), you cleaned up the blog by removing:
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (13,600+ lines deleted!)
- `Gruntfile.js` - the Grunt build configuration
- Related build files (`.jshintrc`, `Rakefile.rb`)

Your blog originally used the **Neo-HPSTR Jekyll theme** which included a Grunt-based build system for CSS/JS processing. After stripping it down (as you suspected), your blog now uses:
- âœ¨ **148 lines** of custom CSS
- âœ¨ **39 lines** of vanilla JavaScript  
- âœ¨ **No build process** or npm dependencies

### The Dependabot PRs

All 7 PRs are trying to update **transitive dependencies** (dependencies of dependencies) of Grunt plugins that no longer exist in your codebase:

1. **#12** - async 2.6.3 â†’ 2.6.4 (dependency of grunt-contrib-clean/watch)
2. **#11** - minimist 1.2.5 â†’ 1.2.7 
3. **#10** - qs 6.5.2 â†’ 6.11.0
4. **#9** - decode-uri-component 0.2.0 â†’ 0.2.2
5. **#7** - minimatch 3.0.4 â†’ 3.0.8
6. **#5** - path-parse 1.0.6 â†’ 1.0.7
7. **#3** - hosted-git-info 2.8.8 â†’ 2.8.9

These PRs exist because Dependabot branches still contain the old `package-lock.json`, but the main branch doesn't use npm anymore.

### Recommendation

**Safe to close all 7 PRs.** The security vulnerabilities they address don't affect your blog since npm packages aren't used.

Consider:
1. Close the PRs with a note that npm dependencies were removed in Jan 2023
2. Disable Dependabot for npm/yarn in repository settings (since you only use Ruby gems via Gemfile)
3. Keep Dependabot enabled for Ruby dependencies if desired

Your instinct was spot-on - these are indeed "leftover from the original one before [you] stripped it down to just a teensy bit of CSS." ðŸŽ¯
